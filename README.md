The task of this assignment was to fill in all of the cases of the switch statements. To do, so you needed to solve 8 image processing problems. For each problem you must implement a static method that take as input an image (and possibly some other information) and returns a new image that is computed from the input image. Then each case clause  calls a method and then show the computed image.
